- Colour:
The colour light green is soothing and calming, in addition it evokes a feeling of
being in harmony with nature. We think this choice of colour will make our target
group more at ease while using our application, possibly increasing their tolerance
for small irritations and frustrations. We also find that this particular shade of
green is easy on the eyes, which may otherwise serve as hindrance.

We have matched this colour with varying shades of light grey, which is mainly used
to attract attention and offer contrast between the multiple parts which makes up a
view. In general, we use lighter colours to draw attention and darker colours to blend
into the background. In addition to this, we use contrasts of different hues of grey
to clearly demarcate different components within the same view.
